# A Linear Regression

This is the repository for the (linear) regression analysis project.

### Description from article

The linear regression is one of the most fundamental techniques used in Econometrics. For this reason, I will explore computer algorithms that allow us to perform such regressions. The method that I will use to solve this optimization problem is the [Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) (OLS) method.
